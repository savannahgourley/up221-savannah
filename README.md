# up221-savannah

## Introduction:
My name is Savannah Gourley and I am second year MPH student studying epidemiology at the Fielding School of Public Health. My research interests include the intersections of HIV, STIs, substance use, and all the other health/social issues that intertwine. This is my first class I've taken within the Urban Planning department. Prior to this class, the only coding and spatial data experience I posses is using SAS. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, running, and going to the movies!

## Description of the course: 
As mentioned in the syllabus, the goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective. We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems.

## Project ideas:
- Documenting infectious disease (i.e. COVID-19 or HIV) cases throughout LA county
- Analyzing SES and the unhoused population throughout LA county SPAs

## My objectives for the class: 
- Learn the basics of programming for Python
- Produce visual maps 
- Learn more about how urban planning and public issues intersect
